A leaping warrior may jump over opposing man-sized models, including enemies, and obstacles 1” high, without penalty. The leap may also be used to leap over gaps, but in this case you must commit the warrior to making the leap before rolling the dice to see how far he jumps. If he fails to make it all the way across, he falls through the gap. \\
\textbf{Sprint} The warrior may triple his Movement rate when he runs or charges, rather than doubling it as normal. \\

\textbf{Dodge} The warrior can avoid any hits from a missile weapon on a D6 roll of 5+. Note that this roll is taken against missiles as soon as a hit is scored to see whether the warrior dodges it or not, before rolling to wound, and before any effects from other skills or equipment (such as lucky charms). \\
\textbf{Scale Sheer Surfaces} The warrior can climb up or down a height equal to twice his normal Movement, and does not need to make Initiative tests when doing so.
