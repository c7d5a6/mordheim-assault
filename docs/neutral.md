## Dwarf Treasure Hunters

### 500 gc

- **Dwarf Noble** (leader): Dwarf axe, Light Armour, Shield
- **Dwarf Engineer** (Expert Weaponsmith): Sword, Pistol (6'';s4)
- **Dwarf Troll Slayer** (Deathwish): Dwarf axe, Dwarf axe
- **Dwarf Thunderer**: Handgun (24'';s4)
- **Dwarf Thunderer**: Handgun (24'';s4)
- **Dwarf Thunderer**: Handgun (24'';s4)

*Dwarf axe*: Cutting Edge, Parry

**Expert Weaponsmith**: A Dwarf Engineer is a master of mechanical devices. By using stronger construction materials and time-tested secrets of Dwarf engineering, a Dwarf Engineer can increase the distance the warband’s missile weapons can shoot. All Dwarf missile weapons in the warband have their range increased by 3" for Pistols and 6" for Crossbows and Handguns. Any range increases are only maintained as long as the Dwarf Engineer remains with the warband.

**Deathwish**: Troll Slayers seek an honourable death in combat. They are completely immune to all psychology and never need to test if fighting alone.
