In the Imperial year 1999, a great comet was sighted in the sky – a twin tailed comet, the sign of Sigmar.</p><p>Astronomers predicted that it would fall in the city of Mordheim, where his convent of Sisters stood. It was believed that it would herald the return of Sigmar, which he would restore the land to its former glory and usher in a new golden age.</p><p>Everybody traveled to Mordheim, filling the city well beyond its capacity.

It smashed into the city, instantly killing those who had gathered around it. Word got out that Sigmar had passed his judgment, that he had smote those who he deemed unworthy.</p><p>The place of Mordheim became a place of fear and paranoia. Soon after, word spread of a mysterious stone that lay scattered about the city, known as Wyrdstone, which had all manner of reputed qualities.</p><p>It was discovered that factions would pay incredible amounts for this precious stone, whatever their motivation.

They are a race for whom pain and pleasure have been pushed to the ultimate extreme. They leave destruction and despair in their wake and are more greatly feared than the barbaric orcs and no less so than the tainted forces of the Chaos and Undeath. To the victims of the Dark Elves it is the fortunate to whom a quick is gifted, for this twisted folk roam the Known World in search of slaves. The slaves of the Dark Elves are either worked to death in their mines, ripped apart on the altars to Khaine, their dark God, or tortured mercilessly by the brides of Khaine, the Witch elves, Dark Elves take a perverse delight in inflicting pain upon others just to see their victims suffer.</p><p>Despite their dire reputation for cruelty, they only rivaled as explorers and adventurers by their High Elven cousins. It is the lure of the precious, arcane artifacts of the Slann that bring these foul creatures to Lustria, travelling stealthily in their Black Arks and penetrating deep into the jungle. Dark Elves are adept at stealth and ambush and are well suited to the overgrown realm of the Lizardmen — most warbands don&#x27;t even know they&#x27;re being attacked until it is too late.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="special-rules"></a>Special Rules<a class="hash-link" href="#special-rules" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><a href="https://broheim.net/downloads/warbands/unofficial/Dark%20Elves.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Elves Warband Rules</a></li></ul><p>All Dark Elves are subject to the following special rules:</p><ul><li><strong>Kindred Hatred:</strong> The Dark Elves have been fighting the High Elves for many centuries.

His family hold may have been overrun by Goblins or Skaven, or he may have somehow disgraced himself and been banished. Other Dwarfs know these warriors as the Dispossessed.

Instead, a noble who finds himself in such dire straits will gather together a group of his closest friends and kin and go treasure hunting, hoping to accumulate a large enough hoard to establish his own holding.

For this reason many Orc warbands have been drawn to the city of Mordheim and the wyrdstone that lies hidden there.

To represent this, at the start of the Orc player’s turn, roll a D6 for each Henchman who is either an Orc or a Goblin. A roll of 1 means that the warrior has taken offense to something one of his mates has done or said. Do not roll for models that are engaged in hand-to-hand combat (they’re already scrappin’!). To find out just how offended the model is, roll another D6 and consult the following chart to see what happens:<br><strong>D6 Result</strong><div class="codeBlockContainer_K1bP"><div class="codeBlockContent_hGly"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_23N8 thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_39YC"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">- **1** “I ’Erd Dat!” The warrior decides that the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin Henchman has insulted his lineage or personal hygiene and must pay the price! If there is a friendly Orc or Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword within charge reach (if there are multiple targets within reach, choose the one nearest to the mad model), the offended warrior will immediately charge and fight a round of hand-to-hand combat against the source of his ire. At the end of this round of combat, the models will immediately move 1&quot; apart and no longer count as being in close combat (unless one of them fails another Animosity test and rolls this result again). If there are no friendly Orc or Goblin Henchmen or Hired Swords within charge reach, and the warrior is armed with a missile weapon, he immediately takes a shot at the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin Henchman or Hired Sword. If none of the above applies, or if the nearest friendly model is an Orc Hero, the warrior behaves as if a 2-5 had been rolled on this chart. In any case, the warrior in question may take no other action this turn, though he may defend himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat.</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">- **2–5** “Wud Yoo Say?” The warrior is fairly certain he heard an offensive sound from the nearest friendly Orc or Goblin, but he’s not quite sure. He spends the turn hurling insults at his mate. He may do nothing else this turn, though he may defend himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat.</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">- **6** “I’ll Show Yer!” The warrior imagines that his mates are laughing about him behind his back and calling him silly names. To show them up he decides that he’ll be the first one to the scrap! This model must move as quickly as possible towards the nearest enemy model, charging into combat if possible. If there are no enemy models within sight, the Orc or Goblin warrior may make a normal move immediately. This move is in addition to his regular move in the Movement phase, so he may therefore move twice in a single turn if you wish. If the extra move takes the Orc or Goblin warrior within charge reach of an enemy model, the warrior must charge into close combat during his regular movement.</span></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_Ue-o clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div></li><li><strong>Distasteful Company:</strong> Many Hired Swords refuse to work for Orcs, as they know that Orcs are just as likely to eat them as fight alongside them.

— <strong>Grandmarshall Blucher von Vincke</strong></p><p>A Liche is a necromancer who was wise enough never to expend his own life energy to fuel his spells during his lifetime. As time eats away at his body, he retains his soul which allows him to manipulate magic, which is what separates them from pitiful wraiths. Unfortunately, the undead bodies of the Liche are not capable of retaining magic forever. They must absorb massive amounts of magic through the use of dark rituals and forbidden spells. The most common ritual involves the devouring of the soul of a human. The soulless human becomes a zombie under the Liche’s control. This continues until he is discovered.</p><p>When a Liche is found, great armies are sent against it. The Liche retaliates by creating armies of undead warriors to defend itself, expending vast amounts of stored magical energy to do so. Win or lose, the Liche is greatly weakened in this process. More often than not, the Liche is crippled such that he is incapable of bringing himself to his former strength. In this event, the Liche has two options. Most of them wander south to the forest of Loren where they seek the wild and infinite magic of the wood. Some wander north towards the Chaos Wastes where they are almost always discovered and destroyed en-route. An even smaller percentage go west in ramshackle boats towards the lands of the High Elves... so far, only a small handful of Liches have ever lived in their undead state for very long; even fewer return to fighting strength after crippling defeat.</p><p>For those who travel north, the journey is long and arduous; dodging road wardens, rogues and thieves all for their goal to reach the Chaos Wastes, where the Liche&#x27;s power will slowly regenerate from the billowing magical winds spewing from the Realm of Chaos. </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="special-rules-3"></a>Special Rules<a class="hash-link" href="#special-rules-3" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><a href="https://broheim.net/downloads/warbands/supplement/btb/The%20Restless%20Dead.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Restless Dead Warband Rules</a></li></ul><div class="div-img"><img class="img" src="/img/bands/undead_symbol_line.png"></div><hr><div class="div-img"><img class="img" align="right" src="/img/bands/he.png"></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="shadow-warriors"></a>Shadow Warriors<a class="hash-link" href="#shadow-warriors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><em>&quot;Do not long for peace, for there can be none while any druchii still draw breath.

— <strong>Alith Anar, Shadow King</strong></p><p>Nagarythe was once one of the most prosperous and beautiful of the kingdoms of the High Elven land of Ulthuan. When the Witch King Malekith and his mother Morathi led the kingdom of Nagarythe astray into worship of the Chaos Gods, not all of their people followed. When Malekith led his people in a rebellion against the rightful Phoenix King, those who had not been converted to depravity remained loyal to the throne of Ulthuan and waged a secret war, a war of shadows, against the Witch King and his armies. When the Witch King was defeated and forced to flee with his followers, most of these ‘shadow warriors’ were killed, drowned by the sea as their land was torn asunder by the Witch King’s foul magics.</p><p>The people of Nagarythe that survived became a nation of wanderers, moving from place to place and never really welcomed by other High Elves, for these Shadow Elves as they became known had gained a reputation for being a fierce and warlike people, full of cruelty. This reputation, while probably only partially true, sets the Shadow Elves apart from other members of their race. This, along with their grim attitude and generally dark presence, makes other High Elves feel ill at ease around them. In Ulthuan they are misfits and outcasts, and many of these proud people seek their fortunes outside Ulthuan entirely. They truly are a race ‘in the shadows’ between the cruel darkness of the Dark Elves, and the beautiful light of the other High Elves.</p><p>Some of the Elves of Nagarythe have been driven mad by this condition, but most have accepted their existence, and are driven on by a desire for revenge against the arch nemesis the Witch King and his perverse mother. The Shadow Elves form themselves into warbands and travel the lands of Ulthuan and the Known World, sometimes fighting Dark Elves (and other forces of Chaos) when they find them, and fighting just to survive the remainder of the time. Some still work in the service of the Phoenix king, acting as scouts and trackers for his armies. Sometimes small units of these warriors will be sent by their king to distant lands on a special mission for Ulthuan – recovery of ancient artifacts left behind when the High Elves abandoned the Old World, or sabotage of a rumoured plot of the Dark Elves. When sent on such a mission, these bands bring their military trappings with them – standards and war horns, unit insignia fiercely emblazoned on their shields – for the Shadow Elves take pride in their loyalty to the Phoenix King. Other warbands represent small groups of warriors seeking their fortune... though still loyal to Ulthuan, they may no longer feel welcome in their island home, or perhaps they represent a family pursuing a personal vendetta against a particular Dark Elf leader. Whatever the case, bands of Shadow Warriors may occasionally be seen roving the lands of the Old World to exploring the steamy jungles of Lustria.</p><p>Due to their wandering nature, it’s not uncommon to see Shadow Warriors travelling the lands of the Empire, so they should fit right in in your normal games of Mordheim. However, the Empire is not the only land these tireless warriors travel to in their quest to rid the world of Dark Elves. As more settings are introduced for the game, you will be able to take your Shadow Warriors to other lands, such as the jungles of Lustria as introduced in Lustria Cities of Gold. You should not feel constrained to keep the Shadow Warriors in one city, it is their nature to wander.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="special-rules-4"></a>Special Rules<a class="hash-link" href="#special-rules-4" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://broheim.net/downloads/warbands/unofficial/Shadow%20Warriors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow Warriors Warband Rules</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Hate Dark Elves:</strong> All warriors in a Shadow Warrior Warband (excluding any Hired Swords) have an unyielding Hatred for Dark Elves.</p></li><li><p><strong>Excellent Sight:</strong> Elves have eyesight unmatched by mere humans.

For centuries they have been content to feed upon his ruins, to seed plague in his cities, and spread contagion amongst his lands. At least they were content to wait and watch, for now everything has suddenly changed. Now the destruction of Mordheim has created new opportunities in the secret war against mankind.</p><p>Since ancient times the Skaven have searched the world for the stones of power that men in their ignorance call wyrdstone but which Skaven have long since known as warpstone, blackstone, or seerstone. It was as a result of gnawing upon this magic stone in ages past that commonplace rats began the slow process of mutation that spawned the Skaven race. Wyrdstone is quite literally in their blood, for they feed upon it and make use of it in their foul sorceries. Until now the ratmen’s search for wyrdstone has been difficult and time-consuming as the stone has grown increasingly rare, but now a new and abundant source has appeared – a dark blessing from the skies!</p><p>For the Skaven of Clan Eshin, this is an especially opportune time for such a thing to happen, for, just as the Empire is divided, so the Skaven race is divided amongst itself. Clan fights clan the world over, each struggling for domination of the Council of Thirteen whose masters rule the Skaven race. Mordheim’s secret is not yet revealed to all the clans, or else the City of the Damned would already be overrun with ratmen. The Nightmaster of Clan Eshin is keen to guard this secret, and for this reason has not sent his multitudinous armies into Mordheim. Instead, he has sent small warbands of Skaven skittering through secret tunnels into the city to gather up the shining stones and bring them back to the clan nests.</p><p>The Skaven of Clan Eshin are supremely adapted to their task. Masters of the art of bringing silent death to their foes, they are skilled in the use of poison and trained in the thousand secrets of the assassin. Since birth Skaven warriors practise martial crafts in the ruinous temples of the Horned Rat, their everhungering and hideous god. There are none better amongst their verminous kind to gather up the treasure of Mordheim, but they must be silent, swift and efficient. Were rival Skaven clans to discover the secret of Mordheim there would come not hundreds, not thousands, but millions upon millions to contend for the wyrdstone in the City of the Damned.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="special-rules-5"></a>Special Rules<a class="hash-link" href="#special-rules-5" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><a href="https://broheim.net/downloads/warbands/official/Skaven.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skaven Warband Rules</a></li></ul><div class="div-img"><img class="img" src="/img/bands/skaven_symbol_line.png"></div></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-tags-row row margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_2ga9 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/docs/tags/mordheim">mordheim</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/docs/tags/page">page</a></li></ul></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/territories"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">« Территории</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/neutral"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Нейтральные банды »</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#mordheim" class="table-of-contents__link">Mordheim</a></li><li><a href="#dark-elves" class="table-of-contents__link">Dark Elves</a><ul><li><a href="#dark-ones-of-naggaroth" class="table-of-contents__link">Dark Ones of Naggaroth</a></li><li><a href="#special-rules" class="table-of-contents__link">Special Rules</a></li><li><a href="#home-rules" class="table-of-contents__link">Home Rules</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#dwarf-treasure-hunters" class="table-of-contents__link">Dwarf Treasure Hunters</a><ul><li><a href="#special-rules-1" class="table-of-contents__link">Special Rules</a></li><li><a href="#home-rules-1" class="table-of-contents__link">Home Rules</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#orc-mob" class="table-of-contents__link">Orc Mob</a><ul><li><a href="#special-rules-2" class="table-of-contents__link">Special Rules</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#the-restless-dead" class="table-of-contents__link">The Restless Dead</a><ul><li><a href="#special-rules-3" class="table-of-contents__link">Special Rules</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#shadow-warriors" class="table-of-contents__link">Shadow Warriors</a><ul><li><a href="#special-rules-4" class="table-of-contents__link">Special Rules</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#skaven" class="table-of-contents__link">Skaven</a><ul><li><a href="#special-rules-5" class="table-of-contents__link">Special Rules</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">Campain</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="http://broheim.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Broheim<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/c7d5a6/mordheim-assault" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">2021 @c7d5a6.</div></div></div></footer></div>
