## Critical Hit Charts

### Missile Weapons

Bows, crossbows, blackpowder weapons, throwing knives etc.:

- **1–2 Hits a Weak Spot.** The missile penetrates its
target’s armour. Ignore all armour saves.
- **3–4 Ricochet.** If there are any other models within
6", the closest enemy model is also hit. Roll to
wound and take any saves as normal for both
targets.
- **5–6 Master Shot.** The missile hits an eye, the
throat, or some other vulnerable part. The
target suffers 2 wounds instead of 1. There is
no armour save.

### Bludgeoning Weapons

Clubs, maces, hammers, flails, double-handed hammers etc.

- **1–2 Hammered.** The target is knocked off
balance. Your opponent may not fight this
turn if he hasn’t already fought.
- **3–4 Clubbed.** The hit ignores armour saves and
saves from helmets.
- **5 Wild Sweep.** Your opponent’s weapon is
knocked from his hand. If he is carrying two
weapons, roll to see which one he loses. He
must fight with whatever back-up weapon he
has in his equipment for the rest of this
combat (or fight unarmed if he has no other
weapons). Roll to wound and take armour
saves as normal.
- **6 Bludgeoned.** The victim automatically goes
out of action if he fails his armour
save. Even if he has several wounds
remaining, he will be taken out of
action by this attack.

### Bladed Weapons

Swords, axes, double-handed swords etc.

- **1–2** Flesh Wound. This attack hits an unprotected
area, so there is no armour save.
- **3–4** Bladestorm. The warrior unleashes a virtual
hail of blows. The attack causes 2 wounds
instead of 1. Take armour saves separately for
each wound. Remember that, as with other
critical hits, if an attack causes multiple
wounds for other reasons as well, you choose
the highest number of wounds.
- **5–6** Sliced! The strike ignores armour
saves, causes 2 wounds, and your
warrior gains +2 to any Injury rolls.

### Unarmed Combat

Wardogs, warhorses, Zombies, Possessed, animals etc.

- **1–2 Body Blow.** Your opponent staggers, allowing
you to seize the initiative and make an
additional attack. Immediately roll to hit and
to wound. Any saves are taken as normal.
- **3–4 Crushing Blow.** The blow lands with
tremendous force. You gain +1 to the Injury
roll if your opponent fails his save.
- **5–6 Mighty Blow.** With a mighty punch or flying
kick, you send your opponent sprawling to
the ground. The attack ignores armour saves
and you gain +2 to any Injury rolls.

### Thrusting Weapons

Spears, halberds, lances etc.

- **1–2 Stab.** With a quick strike, you penetrate your
opponent’s defences. You gain +1 to any
Injury rolls. Armour saves are taken as normal.
- **3–4 Thrust.** The thrust lands with great force and
the target is knocked down. Take armour
saves as normal and see whether the model
suffers a wound.
- **5–6 Kebab!** The thrust knocks the target back with
titanic force, ripping apart armour and
puncturing flesh. The attack ignores armour
saves and you gain +2 to any Injury rolls. The
victim is knocked backwards D6" and the
attacker follows, staying in base contact. Any
other models involved in the combat are
separated and only the model which struck
the blow and his target are still considered
to be in combat. If the target collides with
another model, the other model is hit once
at S3.

## Escaping from combat

Warriors that are engaged in hand-to-hand combat at
the start of their own turn may try to escape from
combat during their movement phase. Such fighters
are assumed to have realised that the odds are against
them and decided that it is just too dangerous for
them to continue.

Declare which of your warriors will try to escape from
combat at the start of your movement phase, at the
same time as you declare charges. Turn the models
around to show this.

Take a Leadership test for each warrior trying to
escape from combat. This represents his efforts to
find the right time to escape. If he passes, the warrior
can move up to double his normal Movement rate
away from combat and the enemy he was fighting, in
any direction.

If he fails, his opponent is allowed to make 1
automatic hit against the warrior who is trying to
escape, and the fleeing warrior (provided he survives)
will run 2D6" directly away from combat. He will have
to take a Leadership test at the beginning of his next
turn.

If successful he will stop, but may not do anything
else during that turn. If the test is failed, he will
continue to run 2D6" towards the closest table edge
and must test again the following turn if he is still on
the table.

If a warrior is charged whilst he is fleeing, the
charger is moved into base contact with
him as normal, but the fleeing warrior
will then immediately run a
further 2D6"
towards the table
edge, before any
blows can be
struck.

## Blackpowder Weapons

- Cost of blackpowder weapons reduced by 20%

### Blackpowder Weapon Misfires

Each time you roll a 1 when rolling to hit with a blackpowder weapon (handgun, pistol, blunderbuss, warplock pistol, etc), roll a D6 and consult the chart below.

- **1 BOOM!** The weapon explodes with a
deafening roar! The shooter suffers an S4 hit
(this does not cause critical hits) and the
weapon is destroyed.
- **2 Jammed.** The weapon is jammed and useless
for the remainder of the battle. You may use
it as normal in the next battle.
- **3 Phut.** The weapon fails to fire and you must
remove the shot. This means that the shooter
must wait one extra turn before he can fire
this weapon again.
- **4–5 Click.** The weapon fails to fire, but there is
no additional effect.
- **6 KA-BOOM!** The weapon roars and spits a
cloud of black smoke and flame! The shot
hits the intended target and counts as having
+1 Strength.

## Home Rules

- When choosing spells for the first time, "Wizards" may roll two dice and pick one of the two spells.
- **Underdogs:** When a warband fights against an enemy warband with a higher rating, its warriors earn extra
Experience points as shown on the table below. Also, warband with lower rating get's reroll as shown on the table below:

| Rating difference | Experience Bonus | Reroll count |
| ---------------- | :--------------: | :----------: |
| 0–50              | None             | 1            |
| 51–75             | +1               | 2            |
| 76–75             | +2               | 3            |
| 101–75            | +3               | 4            |
| 151–75            | +4               | 5            |
| 301+              | +5               | 6            |

<hr/>

- Charge distance is M + 2d6 drop lowest. If model has M 7 or more, or skill that increase charge distance, charge distance is M + 3d6 drop lowest.
- If a model makes a failed charge it moves directly towards the target a distance equal to the score result rolled on the charge roll.

<hr/>

- Big Henchmen (Rat Ogre, Etc) roll on the hero injury list rather than the henchmen list.

<hr/>

- In exploration, if you should roll zero dice, you can roll 2d6 and pick lowest.

<hr/>

- **Dual Wielding**: a warrior using two weapons suffers a -1 to Hit on both attacks. Also, an attack from an off-hand weapon can be parried on a roll EQUAL TO or higher than the roll to hit with the off-hand weapon if the defender can parry. Attacks from additional weapons equipped due to skills (e.g. Tail Fighting) or mutations (e.g. Extra Arm) are exempt from this rule. Weapons that come as a pair (e.g. Fighting Claws) are also exempt from this rule.
- New common Skill **Ambidextrous**: the warrior is adept at two weapon fighting and may ignore the dual wielding penalty. All Hired swords that come with at least two weapons are presumed to have Ambidextrous as a standard.

<hr/>

- Light Armour (5+ save) 15 gc, rare 8
- Heavy Armour (4+ save) 40 gc, rare 9
- Ithilmar Armour (4+ save) 70 gc, rare 11
- Gromril Armour (3+ save) 150 gc, rare 11 [75 gc for dwarf when band created]
- Shield +1 to armor save (adds -1 to M if used with any armor except Ithilmar Armour)
